Run a bit differently to the other session.

Live coding demo maybe?

Main things I want to hit:
- Best practise async programming on iOS.
- Grand central dispatch makes things easy vs semaphores etc.
- We use async stuff to keep the main loop clean, not to do bulk computing.

- Example: doing stuff (drawing) on the main thread to emphasis scrolling
    - Link to WWDC video stuff.

- Real world processing on a background queue

- Thread safety

- Runloop model

- Testing concurrent code
